- Fix translation table: gmp bases less than 36 are 0-9a-z instead of 0-9A-Z
- Fix trailing(i.e. right) zeros: gmp doesn't print them
- Rewrite the whole damn thing in Python
- Automatically detect CPU power / memory to determine max number of digits
- Use multiple cores to speed up search
- Support larger bases, (up to 256?)
- Unicode support (accents, special chars, other alphabets)
